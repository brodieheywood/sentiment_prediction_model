## Description

A sentiment-predicting Python model.

A homework assignment that I completed (alone) for a class in BCIT's
Machine Learning option (in October 2020). 

The goal was to train a model to predict the sentiment of hotel reviews. My 
model was trained on IMDB reviews and scored the highest in the class.

## Contents

- `report_writeup.pdf`: Details of the project, including detailed 
descriptions of the choices I made in the training code.
- `training_code` directory: Contains the Python code (in iPython notebook 
files) used to clean the training data and train the model.
- `model_prediction` directory: Contains an image of the model 
(`lstm_model.h5`), sample input (`sample_reviews_input.csv`), and a Python 
script that can be used to make a prediction on the sample input 
(`predict_rating.py`).

## Making a prediction with the model

You can use the model to make a prediction on the included sample data by 
running the `predict_rating.py` script in the command line. The script 
takes two arguments, the name of the input file and a name for the output 
file. You can use it on the included sample data, like so:

`python3 predict_rating.py sample_reviews_input.csv output.csv`

Where `output.csv` will hold the predictions that the model made for each 
review.
